Calculating PID correlation of all kind of particles which could be accepted by the Grand Raiden.
evtRteEst.C for the excitation energy and tke of some channels
rcnpPID.C for calculation the energy loss in every component of Grand Raiden and the focal plane detector sytstem, drawing vdc1 vs vdc2, vdc2 vs ps1, ps1 vs ps2
